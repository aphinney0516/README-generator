### Description
This CLI application is intended to be used to produce a visually appealing web document database of employees filling the positions of manager, engineer, and intern. It will not only provide easy access to employee information, but it will also provide quick links to employee emails and engineer gitHub accounts. This is the second project where I've learned that I need to do some extra study on how to generate html using both javascript and user input.

### Installation
You must have node installed on your computer along with the appropriate files within a program like VS code.

### Usage
Please see the video below.

### Credits
I worked closely with my tutor, Corey Yates, on this project; however, the one section we ran out of time to work on together was the section on how to generate the html.

### Features
This project contains a command line form and html generation based on the command line form. At least it's supposed to have that last part.

### Future Development
I plan on fixing this project so that it will actually generate the html based on both the user input and the style sheet.
