### Description
The goal of this project was to create a CLI README Generator to use in conjunction with the creation of future projects. It solves the problem of having to reference multiple user guides on the creation of a README and saves time on the creation of the README through auto-formatting. Working through this project helped me realize the potential of node and CLI for the creation of similar template style projects.

### Installation
Utilizing this project will require an operating system that has a CLI interface with node installed and software similar to Visual Studio Code. The code can then be retrieved from the GitHub repository linked under the "Questions" section.

### Usage

### Credits
Once I completed the initial draft of the required coding my tutor Corey Yates helped me fine tune it. You can find more of her work at https://github.com/cqyates.

### Features
The license badge at the top of the page links to the licensing information (if your project includes a license). The table of contents links to each respective part of the README. All GitHub user and repository links are active.

### Future Development
As this is merely the beginning of my web development career, as I advance I'm sure my READMEs will get more and more complicated, so I will continue to update the code of this README Generator in order to facilitate more extensive READMEs.
